					<description><![CDATA[<p>Effective June 19, I am resigning my position w/ TownNews.com as their WordPress Architect for their Rayos publishing platform. I liked the job. The work was substantive. Most of the people were nice enough. When I started in October 2019, I came into a software-in-transition. TN had acquired the Rayos platform from GTXcel, and my&#160; <a href="https://patrickgodbey.com/2020/06/18/thoughts-about-leaving-townnews-com/">&#8230; Read more <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i></a></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>I am using Publii to manage my site now. It is a locally installed/managed static site generator/CMS that builds and uploads your site content to a variety of hosting providers. I have it using Github Pages as my provider. I like Publii because of it&#8217;s simplicity.
